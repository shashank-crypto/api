## to think

- should I create a modifiers folder and check the roles and authorizations or should I create a modifiers.js file and club the functions there
- creating the delivery system > providing the delivery system
    - sharing the locations for the subscribers for one single subscriptions. (among number of drivers) 
    { min : 10}
    - defining rules for delivery

- modifiers :
    - modifiers check at the roles and define rules, but I need to define roles and rules for each roles somwhere.
